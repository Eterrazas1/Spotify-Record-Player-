# Spotify-Record-Player-
This project utilizes Raspberry Pi and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to allow users to play their personalized playlists, songs they love, and albums at the touch of a scan.

I would like to preface by stating this project was originally done by Talaexe, a programmer who developed a "Modern Day Record Player" by using Spotify API's as well. I saw Talaexe's version of this project online a year ago, and I was inspired to take on this project and add some elements of my own! 

As mentioned previously, the build uses a raspberry pi and functions as the base for all the computing and scanning done to play Spotify playlists, songs, and/or albums. An RFID scanner is attached to the pi, and this is done to allow simple tag activation (similar to that of a credit card when using the tap feature) to play music through the pi. As users add to their list of music in the main.py file, more tags will be used in order to assign specific songs, playlists, or albums to those tags. 

Along with using these two pieces of technology, this project combines Spotify API's in order to retrieve user's personal information and data. With the permission of users, Spotify allows data to be shared to the host's device. This allows the raspberry pi to retrieve data when a specific tag is scanned by the user and play what the user has called.  

This was a project I was passionate about because of my love for music and computer engineering. I am constantly using Spotify to play my music, and when I saw this exciting and accessible way to play music (and quite literally at the palm of my hands!), I knew I had to take on this challenge and make it my own!
